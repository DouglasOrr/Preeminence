    "Preeminence is a world domination game where 2-6 automated agents compete for ownership of territory on a map. Owning territories is a certified _Good Thing_ in Preeminence - it earns you extra armies, gives you access to enemy territories to expand your region of control and ultimately it can win you the game (when you own every territory on the map). Your agent plays Preeminence by **placing** armies on owned territories, then **attacking** adjacent enemy territories. Here is the _classic_ map, with territories randomly divided between 3 players (this is how the game starts):\n",

    "Now to the heart of the matter - let's create an Agent capable of playing a game! Your agent must inherit from `preem.Agent` (from now on we'll use `import preem as P` to make this `P.Agent`), and override 4 required methods. These make decisions about **army placement** (`place`, `reinforce`), strategic use of **bonus armies from redeeming cards** (`redeem`) and **army movement and attacking** (`act`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each method is called in a preditable order during a game:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Agent method flow](docs/agent_flow.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    " - The game sets up the map, assigns starting territories randomly to each player.\n",
    " - Game calls `place` repeatedly (for each player in turn) to place a single army on an owned territory, until enough initial armies have been placed.\n",
    " - For each turn, game:\n",
    "   - calls `redeem` to decide which, if any, cards should be declared for bonus armies,\n",
    "   - calls `reinforce` to place multiple armies on one or more owned territories,\n",
    "   - calls `act` repeatedly, until it returns a turn-ending action (such as a move).\n",
